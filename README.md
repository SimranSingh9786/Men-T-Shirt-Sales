A dynamic Power BI dashboard was created with retail data from four separate files.At the end, my goal was to create a high-level dashboard with a variety of cuts, as well as some insights. As a first step, imported all 4 tables into the data model and ensure the relationships between them are well defined.. Then added some fields to enable the different views - Net Units, Weekday vs Weekend Performance etc.
