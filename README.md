A dynamic Power BI dashboard was created with retail data from four separate files.At the end, my goal was to create a high-level dashboard with a variety of cuts, as well as some insights. As a first step, imported all 4 tables into the data model and ensure the relationships between them are well defined.After that cleaned and transform data.Then added some fields to enable the different views - Net Units, Weekday vs Weekend Performance etc.After adding fields,with the help of different charts(Pie,Bar),table,slicer and KPIs made interactive dashboard highlighting key performaces with respect to zone,city tier,month,days etc.
